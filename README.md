## setup and general stuffs 

- In your machine learning and data science journey, you will mostly be using python as your language. For a code editor, VS code is a good starting option, so set it up. [setup instructions](https://youtu.be/mpk4Q5feWaw?si=610Wjb7jsQlKi-gX)
- For any kind of errors or issues during setup (or in general coding), make sure to roam on the internet (especially stack exchange) before asking any mentors about it.
- Make yourself familiar with `git` and `github` as you proceed with collaborative development. [basic commands](https://youtu.be/rE2zRhZdjFU?si=A-V2hjahIymqJrj6)
